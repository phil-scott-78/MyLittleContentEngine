### Container Options
- Individual pots (4-6 inch diameter minimum)

- Water thoroughly but infrequently
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot

### Harvesting Techniques

- **Pest issues**: Inspect regularly, isolate affected plants

## Seasonal Considerations

### Summer

- Harvest frequently to prevent bolting

### Winter

- Supplement with grow lights if needed
- Many herbs go dormant - this is normal

## Advanced Tips
