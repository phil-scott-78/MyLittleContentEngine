## Brewing Methods

### French Press
The forgiving method perfect for beginners:

1. Use a 1:15 coffee-to-water ratio
2. Grind beans coarsely
3. Steep for 4 minutes
4. Press slowly and serve immediately

### Pour-Over
For those who enjoy the ritual:

1. Use a 1:16 ratio for lighter, cleaner taste
2. Medium-fine grind
3. 30-second bloom with twice the water weight
4. Pour in slow, circular motions

### Cold Brew
The patient person's reward:

1. 1:8 ratio for concentrate
2. Coarse grind
3. Steep 12-24 hours at room temperature
4. Filter and dilute to taste

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Extraction
Signs: Bitter, harsh flavors
Solution: Coarser grind, shorter brew time, or lower water temperature

### Under-Extraction
Signs: Sour, weak coffee
Solution: Finer grind, longer brew time, or hotter water

### Stale Beans
Use beans within 2-4 weeks of roast date for optimal flavor.

## Pro Tips

- Water quality matters - use filtered water
- Consistency beats perfection - find your method and stick with it
- Keep a brewing journal to track what works
- Fresh grinding makes the biggest difference
