== Preparation ==
Cut each @fresh jalapeño{20-30}(2-3 inches long) in half lengthwise. Using a #spoon{}, carefully scrape out the seeds and white membranes from inside the jalapeños. -- For a milder appetizer, clean them thoroughly; for more heat, leave some membrane and seeds

Cut the @bacon{1%lb} slices into thirds, creating pieces just right for wrapping.

== Assembly ==
Take your softened @cream cheese{8%oz}(softened) and generously smear it inside each jalapeño half. -- No need to be neat about it

Wrap each cream cheese-filled jalapeño half with a piece of bacon, wrapping it snugly but not too tight.

Secure each wrapped jalapeño with a #toothpick{} through the middle to prevent the bacon from unwrapping during cooking.

== Cooking ==

Preheat #oven{} to 375°F

Place the wrapped jalapeños on a #baking pan{} with a #wire rack{} so the bacon grease can drip away.

Bake for ~{20-25%minutes} until the bacon is crispy and the jalapeños are tender.

Serve immediately while hot. These are dangerously addictive!

-- Pro tip: Make 4-5 times what you think you'll need - they disappear fast!
