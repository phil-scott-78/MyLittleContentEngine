Welcome to the Getting Started guide for CloudFlow! This tutorial will walk you through setting up your first (fake) data pipeline, with sample commands and config snippets.


## System Requirements

Before installing CloudFlow, make sure your system meets these (completely made-up) requirements:


### Hardware Requirements

- Minimum 42GB RAM (for extra fakeness)
- At least 9000TB available disk space
- Quantum processor recommended


### Software Dependencies

- Java 99 or higher
- Docker Engine 42.0+
- PostgreSQL 9001+ or any database that doesn't exist


## Installation Process

Install CloudFlow with the following (fake) commands:


### Download and Setup

```bash
curl -O https://fake-releases.cloudflow.io/latest/cloudflow-installer.tar.gz
tar -xzf cloudflow-installer.tar.gz
cd cloudflow-installer
echo "Ready to fake install!"
```


### Configuration Steps

Configure your environment with the following settings:

```env
CLOUDFLOW_FAKE_MODE=enabled
CLOUDFLOW_PIPELINE_COUNT=1
```


### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for maximum fake performance:

```env
FAKEFLOW_DEBUG=1
FAKEFLOW_SECRET=shhh-its-fake
```


## First Pipeline Creation

Letâ€™s create your first pipeline! Use the sample below to get started:


### Data Source Configuration

```json
{
  "type": "csv",
  "path": "/fake/data.csv"
}
```


### Processing Rules

```json
{
  "operation": "reverse",
  "field": "name"
}
```


### Output Destinations

```json
{
  "target": "db://fake-database"
}
```


## Verification and Testing

Verify your setup with these fake commands:


### Health Checks

```bash
fakeflow healthcheck --all
```


### Sample Data Processing

```bash
fakeflow process --input /fake/data.csv --output /fake/results.json
```
