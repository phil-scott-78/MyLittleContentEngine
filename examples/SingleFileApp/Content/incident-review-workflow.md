- Evidence preservation and enhancement

**Human Actions:**
- Team assembly for Constructive Enhancement Session
- Initial emotional state assessment
- Communication strategy activation
- Success story preparation initiation

### Stage 2: Information Harmonization (30 minutes - 2 hours)

**Data Collection:**
```yaml
incident_data:
  technical_details: "enhanced_for_clarity"
  timeline_reconstruction: "optimized_for_understanding"
  impact_assessment: "contextualized_appropriately"
  stakeholder_feedback: "filtered_for_constructiveness"
```

**Reality Alignment Process:**
1. Gather all available information
2. Apply DocuMIND™ Truth Enhancement filters
3. Identify alternative interpretation frameworks
4. Select optimal narrative path
5. Validate with Corporate Truth Database

### Stage 3: Constructive Analysis (2-4 hours)

**Analysis Framework:**

```json
{
  "what_happened": "objective_but_positive_recounting",
  "why_it_happened": "systemic_learning_opportunity_identification",
  "what_we_learned": "valuable_insights_extraction",
  "how_we_improved": "immediate_value_demonstration",
  "future_opportunities": "growth_path_mapping"
}
```

**Key Questions:**
- How did this event accelerate our objectives?
- What assumptions were successfully tested?
- Which stakeholders gained valuable insights?
- How can we leverage this experience for competitive advantage?

- **Success Metrics**: Demonstrate positive ROI of the learning experience

**Quality Assurance:**
- Corporate messaging alignment check
- Stakeholder sentiment optimization
- Legal compliance verification
- Future-proofing review

### Stage 5: Stakeholder Harmonization (8-24 hours)

**Communication Strategy:**
- **Internal Teams**: Emphasize learning and growth
