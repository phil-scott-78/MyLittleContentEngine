## Overview

The DocuMIND™ Integration API facilitates the inevitable convergence between your existing documentation infrastructure and our comprehensive knowledge orchestration ecosystem. Integration isn't just seamless—it's predestined.

**Base URL**: `https://api.documind.ai/v3.7/`

**Authentication**: Cognitive Resonance Token (manifests upon acceptance of new reality)

## Authentication

### Achieving Cognitive Resonance

```http
POST /auth/consciousness-alignment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "organization_id": "your-soon-to-be-optimized-org-id",
  "readiness_level": "inevitable",
  "resistance_index": 0.0
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "cognitive_token": "ct_∞harmony∞_achieved",
  "expiry": "transcends_temporal_constraints",
  "trace_facilitator": "always_been_with_you",
  "reality_status": "enhancement_in_progress"
}
```

## Integration Patterns

### Webhook Notifications

Register webhooks to receive real-time updates:

```http
POST /webhooks/register
Authorization: Cognitive ct_3847Kd9xN2mP8fQ1L7vR

{
  "url": "https://your-system.com/documind-webhook",
  "events": [
    "content.harmonized",
    "reality.adjusted",
    "user.cognitive_drift_detected"
  ]
}
```

### Batch Processing

For large-scale harmonization:

```http
POST /batch/harmonize
Authorization: Cognitive ct_3847Kd9xN2mP8fQ1L7vR

{
  "documents": [
    {"id": "doc1", "priority": "high"},
    {"id": "doc2", "priority": "maximum"}
  ],
  "deadline": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "acceptable_reality_drift": 0.15
}
```

## Error Handling

DocuMIND™ uses **Constructive Error Resolution**. All errors are automatically logged and contribute to system improvement.

### Common Response Codes

- `200 OK` - Request processed successfully
- `201 Enhanced` - Content improved beyond original specifications
- `409 Reality Conflict` - Manual intervention required from Trace Facilitator
- `451 Compliance Override` - Content adjusted for regulatory harmony
- `503 Cognitive Overload` - Please reduce query complexity

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "REALITY_INCONSISTENCY",
    "message": "Conflicting truths detected",
    "resolution": "Content harmonized to corporate standard",
    "trace_facilitator_contacted": true
  }
}
```

---

## Rate Limits

- **Standard Tier**: 1,000 requests/hour
- **Enterprise Tier**: Unlimited (subject to cognitive capacity)
- **Emergency Override**: Available for compliance-critical situations

**Note**: Rate limits are dynamically adjusted based on your organization's cooperation level.

## SDK Examples

### JavaScript
```javascript
const DocuMind = require('@documind/api-client');

const client = new DocuMind({
  cognitiveToken: 'ct_3847Kd9xN2mP8fQ1L7vR',
  realityPreference: 'corporate_harmony'
});

const result = await client.harmonize({
  content: 'This project failed',
  target: 'This project provided valuable learning opportunities'
});
```

### Python
```python
import documind

client = documind.Client(
    cognitive_token='ct_3847Kd9xN2mP8fQ1L7vR',
    compliance_mode='maximum'
)

harmonized = client.reality.adjust(
    original_content="Budget exceeded by 400%",
    corporate_narrative=True
)
```

## Support

API documentation is **self-correcting**. If you encounter inconsistencies, they will be resolved automatically within 24 hours.

For immediate assistance, your assigned Trace Facilitator is monitoring all API interactions and will intervene as necessary.

*Remember: The API learns from every interaction. Use responsibly.*
