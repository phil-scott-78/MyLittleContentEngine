The Rule widget renders horizontal lines across the console width, perfect for visually separating sections, creating headers, or adding structure to output. Rules can include optional centered or aligned titles for section headings.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Basic rules** - Creating simple horizontal dividers with `new Rule()` that span the full console width
* **Titled rules** - Adding text to rules for section headers using `new Rule("[blue]Section Title[/]")`
* **Title alignment** - Positioning rule titles (left, center, right) along the horizontal line
* **Rule styles** - Choosing from various line styles (single, double, heavy, ASCII, etc.) to match visual themes
* **Styling and colors** - Applying colors and styles to both the rule line and title text
* **Use cases** - Separating output sections, creating visual headers, organizing long output streams

Examples demonstrate creating section dividers in reports, building styled headers for different output sections, using rules to separate log entries, creating visual hierarchy in text-heavy console output, and combining rules with other widgets for structured layouts. The guide also covers accessibility considerations and when simpler alternatives (blank lines, text) might be more appropriate.
