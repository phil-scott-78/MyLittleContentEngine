The Json widget displays JSON data with beautiful syntax highlighting, proper indentation, and color-coded elements, making it easy to visualize JSON structures in console applications. It's essential for debugging, displaying API responses, and showing configuration data.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Loading JSON** - Creating Json widgets from strings, objects, files, or streams
* **Syntax highlighting** - Color coding for keys, values, strings, numbers, booleans, and null
* **Customizing colors** - Configuring colors for different JSON element types to match themes
* **Indentation** - Controlling indentation levels for nested structures
* **Member sorting** - Alphabetically sorting object keys for consistency
* **Array handling** - Displaying arrays with proper formatting and nesting
* **Use cases** - Debugging API responses, displaying configuration, showing data structures

Examples demonstrate rendering API response JSON, displaying application configuration files, formatting nested data structures, showing validation results, debugging JSON parsing issues, and integrating JSON display into diagnostic tools. The guide also covers performance considerations for large JSON documents and alternatives for extremely complex structures.
