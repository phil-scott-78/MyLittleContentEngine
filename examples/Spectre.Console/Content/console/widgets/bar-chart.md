The BarChart widget visualizes numeric data as horizontal or vertical bars, making it easy to compare values visually. Bar charts are ideal for showing categorical data, rankings, statistics, and comparative metrics in console applications.

**Key Topics Covered:**

* **Creating bar charts** - Adding data items with labels and values using `AddItem()`
* **Bar orientation** - Switching between horizontal (default) and vertical bar charts
* **Labels and colors** - Assigning descriptive labels and custom colors to each bar for visual distinction
* **Width configuration** - Setting the maximum width of bars to control chart size
* **Value display** - Showing or hiding numeric values alongside bars
* **Sorting** - Ordering bars by value (ascending/descending) or maintaining input order
* **Styling** - Customizing bar characters, colors, and label formatting

Examples demonstrate creating horizontal bar charts for survey results, building vertical bar charts for monthly metrics, comparing performance statistics across categories, visualizing resource usage percentages, displaying ranking data, and creating colorful dashboards with multiple chart widgets. The guide discusses best practices for chart readability, choosing appropriate value ranges, and when bar charts are more effective than other visualization approaches.
