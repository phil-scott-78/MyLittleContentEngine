A reference page for table and panel border styles. Spectre.Console provides several preset border types (e.g. **Ascii**, **Rounded**, **Square**, **Double**, **Heavy**). This page shows each border style with an example table so users can see how they look. It lists the constant names (if any, like `TableBorder.Rounded`) and explains when to use them (e.g. ASCII for maximum compatibility vs. rounded for nicer aesthetics). This helps users quickly pick a border for tables, panels, or grids to match their desired console look.
