A list of all emoji shortcodes supported by Spectre.Console's Markup. It shows the text code (like `:smile:`) and the corresponding Unicode symbol ðŸ˜€. This reference makes it easy to find an emoji to include in console output without remembering the Unicode. It also notes that emoji rendering depends on the console's font and that not all consoles support color emoji. Example usage is given (e.g. `AnsiConsole.Markup("Hello :wave:")`). This ensures developers can add some visual flair using emoji icons in a supported way.
