A listing of text styles and decoration options. It describes the style flags like **bold**, **dim**, **italic**, **underline**, **strikethrough**, etc., and how to apply them via markup tags or the `Style` class. It includes examples of combining styles (e.g. bold+underline) and notes which styles might not be supported on all consoles. Additionally, this reference covers the **Decoration** property on `AnsiConsole` (for setting global decoration) and how to reset decorations. It provides a quick lookup for all style names that Spectre.Console recognizes in markup.
