A reference of built-in spinner animations available for the **Status** and **Spinner** APIs. It lists each spinner by name (e.g. `Spinner.Known.Dots`, `Spinner.Known.Star`, etc.) and provides a preview of the pattern (e.g. for Dots, a sequence of dot characters frames). For each spinner, it notes the symbol sequence and interval. The page also explains how to create a custom spinner by specifying a series of frames manually. By consulting this list, users can choose an appropriate spinner animation for their long-running tasks or use it with the async spinner extension.
