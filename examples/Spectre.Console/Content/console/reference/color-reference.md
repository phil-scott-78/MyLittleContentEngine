A comprehensive reference of color usage in Spectre.Console. This page lists the ways to specify colors: named **ANSI colors** (like `red`, `green`, `blue`, etc.), the 256-color palette indexes, and 24-bit hex colors. It enumerates the 16 basic color names and explains that Spectre.Console auto-detects the terminal's color support (3-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, or 24-bit). Examples show using `Color.Red` in code versus markup `[red]`. It also notes how foreground and background colors can be set, and how to reset to defaults. This reference ensures users know all available color specifications for consistent theming.
