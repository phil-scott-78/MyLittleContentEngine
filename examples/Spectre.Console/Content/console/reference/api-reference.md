Links to the complete API reference for Spectre.Console (auto-generated documentation). This includes detailed descriptions of all classes, methods, and properties not covered in the guides. For example, the full `AnsiConsole` API with all overloads, the `IRenderable` interface, `Profile` and `Capabilities` details, etc. Readers are directed here for low-level details and types. (This will likely link to the Spectre.Console API docs website or generated docs.)
