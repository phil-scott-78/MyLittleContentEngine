How to draw graphics in the console using the **Canvas** and **CanvasImage** widgets. The guide explains creating a `Canvas` with a specific size and plotting colored "pixels" on it to draw shapes or simple images (e.g. a smiley face or a low-res logo). It then shows how to use `CanvasImage` to take an image (or a 2D data array) and render an ASCII representation in the console. Readers will learn how to control color fidelity (knowing Spectre.Console supports 3-bit to 24-bit colors depending on terminal capabilities) and how to scale images or adjust dithering for better console representation. By the end, developers will be able to include basic graphics alongside text output.
