How to create simple charts and visualizations in the console. This guide covers the **BarChart** widget for rendering bar graphs and the **BreakdownChart** for pie-chart-like breakdowns of percentages. It explains how to supply data series, labels, and customize colors for each segment. Additionally, it shows how to display a **Calendar** widget to render a monthly calendar view in text (useful for highlighting dates) and how to use the **Rule** widget to draw separators (which can act as a visual timeline or section break). By following the steps, readers can generate console-based charts (for example, a bar chart of task durations or a breakdown of categories) to visually represent data in a text environment.
