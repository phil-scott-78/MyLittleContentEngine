How to output structured data like JSON and file system paths in a readable way. This guide shows how to use the **JsonHighlight** (JSON) widget to pretty-print JSON strings or objects with syntax highlighting of braces, keys, and values. It covers customizing the colors for different JSON elements if needed. The guide also covers the **TextPath** widget, which is used to render file or directory paths in a truncated, friendly format. It demonstrates how a long file path can be automatically cropped to fit the console width and styled (e.g. drive, separators, and folder names in different colors). By using these widgets, developers can display config files, data, or file locations in a user-friendly manner without writing custom formatting logic.
