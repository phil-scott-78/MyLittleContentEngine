How to add decorative text and art to the console. This guide focuses on using the **Figlet** text renderer to create large ASCII-art text from strings (great for banners or headings), covering how to choose fonts and apply colors to Figlet output. It also mentions using emojis in text (via the `:shortcode:` syntax) to enrich output with icons. The guide provides examples of printing a stylized application title with Figlet, drawing a line with `Rule` for emphasis, and sprinkling some emoji symbols for fun. Tips are included on ensuring the console font supports the Unicode characters (as Spectre.Console can auto-detect and fallback for unsupported characters).
