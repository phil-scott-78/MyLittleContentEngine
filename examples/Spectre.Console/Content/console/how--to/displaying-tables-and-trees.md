How to present structured data in the console using **Table** and **Tree** widgets. This guide covers creating a `Table` with columns, adding rows of data, and customizing borders and styles (using different border types and column alignment). It also covers the **Tree** widget for hierarchical data, showing how to build a tree of nodes and style each node. Practical examples include a table of results from an API and a file system directory tree. The guide demonstrates using built-in **Borders** styles (from simple to double lines) and how to handle wide content gracefully. By following this, users can format data into easy-to-read tables or expandable trees.
