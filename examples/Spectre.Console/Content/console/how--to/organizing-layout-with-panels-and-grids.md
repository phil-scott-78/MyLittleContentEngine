How to arrange multiple pieces of output using layout widgets such as **Panel**, **Grid**, **Columns**, **Rows**, and **Align**. This guide shows how to use `Panel` to draw a bordered panel around content (e.g. to call out an important message), and how to use `Align` and `Padder` to position content within a region. It introduces the **Grid** layout for placing content in a flexible row-by-column arrangement (like a table without explicit borders), as well as using `Columns`/`Rows` containers and the higher-level **Layout** system to divide the console into regions. Examples include creating a two-column layout (using `Columns` or `Grid`) to display side-by-side panels, and using `Align.Center` to center text or ASCII art in the console. The guide ensures every container widget (Align, Padder, Panel, Grid, etc.) is demonstrated so developers can effectively organize complex console UIs.
