How to write unit tests for console applications built with Spectre.Console. This guide introduces the `Spectre.Console.Testing` library and how it provides test harnesses for console output. It shows how to use `TestConsole` to simulate a console â€“ capturing output and supplying input. For Spectre.Console rendering, it demonstrates writing tests that verify the output string (for example, ensuring a certain table or message was written). For interactive prompts, it shows how to queue input responses (via `TestConsole.Input`) so that when code calls `AnsiConsole.Prompt` or `Ask`, the test provides predefined answers. Additionally, if using Spectre.Console.Cli (the CLI parser) together, it explains the `CommandAppTester` which can execute a command and capture its output and exit code. The guide emphasizes structuring console code to inject an `IAnsiConsole` (as shown in the examples) for testability. By following this, developers can confidently validate their console apps' behavior automatically.
