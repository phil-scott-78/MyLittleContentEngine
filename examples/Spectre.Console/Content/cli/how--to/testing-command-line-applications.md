How to test CLI apps built with Spectre.Console.Cli to ensure they parse and execute correctly. This guide introduces the `CommandAppTester` class from Spectre.Console.Testing, which allows running commands in-memory. It shows how to set up a test: instantiate a `CommandAppTester`, register commands (or even pass in a registrar for DI if needed), then call `app.Run(args)` and capture the `CommandAppResult`. The guide demonstrates asserting on the `ExitCode` and captured `Output` string to verify that a given input produces the expected outcome (for example, running `app.Run(new[]{"hello","--name","Bob"})` yields exit code 0 and output contains "Hello Bob"). It also covers testing interactive commands by using `TestConsole` â€“ for instance, feeding input to a prompt-driven command and verifying the output. Best practices are discussed, such as injecting `IAnsiConsole` into commands rather than using `AnsiConsole` directly, which makes it easier to capture output in tests. Following this guide, developers can automate testing of their CLI argument parsing and command logic, catching regressions or incorrect behaviors early.
