Link to the full Spectre.Console.Cli API documentation for all classes and members. This is where one would find detailed info on classes like `CommandApp`, `Command`, `CommandSettings`, exceptions thrown by the library (e.g. `Spectre.Console.Cli.CommandParseException`), and so on. The docs will likely direct users here for any API detail not covered in the how-to or reference pages.
