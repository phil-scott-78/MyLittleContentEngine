Welcome to my new content site! This is my first post using MyLittleContentEngine.

## What is MyLittleContentEngine?

MyLittleContentEngine is a static site generator built specifically for .NET Blazor applications. It allows you to:

- Write content in Markdown
- Use `dotnet watch` to develop your site
- Generate static HTML for fast loading at deployment

## Getting Started

Creating content is as simple as writing Markdown files with YAML front matter. The engine handles the rest! Except the
writing!

```csharp
var theAnswer = 30 + 25;
```

And that's it! You now have a basic content site up and running with MyLittleContentEngine.
