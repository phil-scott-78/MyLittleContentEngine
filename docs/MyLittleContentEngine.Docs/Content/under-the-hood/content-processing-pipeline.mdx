The static site generation pipeline in MyLittleContentEngine transforms your Blazor application into a collection of
pre-rendered HTML files. This process is orchestrated by the `OutputGenerationService.GenerateStaticPages` method, which
coordinates multiple subsystems to produce a complete static website.

## Overview of the Generation Process

The static generation pipeline follows a carefully orchestrated sequence of operations:
<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
## Page Collection and Discovery

The pipeline begins by collecting all pages that need to be generated from multiple sources:

### Content Service Pages

Each registered `IContentService` (such as `MarkdownContentService` or `ApiReferenceContentService`) contributes pages
based on their content sources. For example:

- Markdown files become individual pages
- API documentation generates namespace and type pages
- Custom content services can add specialized pages

### Route Discovery

The system automatically discovers routes from two sources:

#### Blazor Component Routes

When `AddPagesWithoutParameters` is enabled, the `RoutesHelperService` scans assemblies for Blazor components with
`@page` directives. This discovers routes like:

- `@page "/about"` becomes `/about/index.html`
- `@page "/contact"` becomes `/contact/index.html`

Only non-parameterized routes are included (routes without `{parameter}` segments).

#### MapGet Endpoints

The system also discovers HTTP GET endpoints registered via `app.MapGet()`. These are assigned `Priority.MustBeLast`
because they often include dynamically generated content like CSS files that depend on other pages being processed first. This includes generating the MonorailCSS stylesheet if it's been registered.

### Explicit Pages

Additionally, pages can be explicitly defined in configuration through the `PagesToGenerate` option.

<Step stepNumber="2">

## Output Directory Preparation

Before generation begins, the output directory is completely cleared and recreated. This ensures a clean slate for each generation run, preventing stale files from previous builds.


</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
## Static Asset Collection and Copying

The pipeline collects and copies all static assets from multiple sources:

### Web Root Assets

Standard `wwwroot` files from the main application are automatically included.

### Razor Class Library Assets

Static assets from referenced Razor Class Libraries are automatically included. This includes `scripts.js` from the `MyLittleContentEngine.UI` library, which is essential for the UI functionality.

### Content Engine Assets

Custom content directories registered via `MapContentEngineStaticAssets` are included with their assets mapped to specific request paths.

### Content Service Assets

Individual content services can contribute their own static assets through the `GetContentToCopyAsync` method.

All collected assets are then copied to the output directory, respecting the `IgnoredPathsOnContentCopy` configuration.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
## Page Generation with Priority Ordering

Pages are generated in priority order to handle dependencies correctly. The system uses three priority levels:

- **`MustBeFirst` (0)**: Pages that other pages might depend on
- **`Normal` (50)**: Standard content pages
- **`MustBeLast` (100)**: Pages that depend on other pages (like CSS files that need to scan generated HTML)

Within each priority level, pages are generated in parallel for optimal performance.

### Page Rendering Process

Each page is rendered by making an HTTP request to the running Blazor application. The rendered HTML is then saved to the appropriate location in the output directory, with directories created as needed.
