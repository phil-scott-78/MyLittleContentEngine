# Front Matter and Type Safety

*Understanding the benefits and implementation of MyLittleContentEngine's strongly-typed front matter system.*

## Why Strongly-Typed Front Matter?

Traditional static site generators use loosely-typed YAML front matter, leading to:
- Runtime errors from typos or missing properties
- No IntelliSense support in editors
- Inconsistent data across content files
- Difficulty refactoring content structures

MyLittleContentEngine solves these problems with compile-time type checking.
