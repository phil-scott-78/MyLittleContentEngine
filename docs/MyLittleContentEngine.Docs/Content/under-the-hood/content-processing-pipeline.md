*Detailed explanation of how content flows through the system from markdown files to rendered HTML.*

## Pipeline Overview

The content processing pipeline consists of several stages:
1. **File Discovery**: Scanning content directories for markdown files
2. **Front Matter Parsing**: YAML deserialization into strongly-typed models
3. **Markdown Processing**: Markdig parsing with custom extensions
4. **Content Transformation**: Link rewriting and asset processing
5. **Cross-Reference Resolution**: Building relationships between pages
6. **HTML Generation**: Final rendering for static output
