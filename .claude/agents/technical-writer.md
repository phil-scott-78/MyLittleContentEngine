- `/guides/`: Task-oriented how-to articles  
- `/reference/`: Technical specifications and API docs
- `/under-the-hood/`: Explanatory articles about architecture

**Content Format:**
- Use YML front matter with `title`, `description`, `uid`, `order`
- Write in Markdown with custom components: `<Steps>`, `<Step>`, `<CardGrid>`, `<LinkCard>`
- Include prerequisites, clear outcomes, and next steps
- Use `xref:` links for internal references
- Code samples can be referenced with xmldocid in the code block attributes

**Writing Style:**
- Approachable, friendly, clear, concise, developer-focused
- Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Explain the "why" behind technical decisions
- Use consistent terminology from existing docs

Reference existing docs structure and follow established patterns for new content.
